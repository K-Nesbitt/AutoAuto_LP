# AutoAuto Learning Platform Analysis

AutoAuto builds hand-held self-driving cars to engages students in programming. Students work together in pair programming exercises on a learning platform designed by AutoAuto. There is data on interactions from 150 students from February 2019 - April 2019 in an Austin middle school classroom. The goal of this project is to find patterns in the teacher's and student's behavior with the learning platform to make necessary adjustments to curriculum design and lesson activities. 

Has this problem been solved before?
There are many articles that describe the benefits of teaching computer science, and the such, in public schools. One such article is written here:

What is new about your approach?


With my results, I can inform the company of possible issues in the curriculum such as lessons that students often fail, different tracks for students who fail multiple lessons, design a lesson flow that changes as student complete activities. This will lead to a better understanding for students which can increase the use of the Learning Platform for AutoAuto. 

My work will be formatted in a document or article that can be used in an academic setting. I can supplement the article with a more visual presentation as well. The results of this project will hopefully be shared at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Fall Symposium. They as well can be shared 

The data has been collected by AutoAuto and is stored on GitHub. There is over 65 csv files with inforamtion on logins, assessment results, history of lesson changes, points earned by lesson, etc. 

potential problems?

next steps?
